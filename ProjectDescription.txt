This is a classification problem. The training data contain of 463,715 samples, and the test data contain
51,630 samples. The features are 90 dimensional and real-valued. The possible labels are 0 (36,487; 8%), 1
(149,746; 32%), 2 (277,482; 60%), where the values in parentheses denote the number of samples with each
label and their proportions.

Each data point is a song, and the features are related to how much power there is in different frequencies
throughout the song. The labels are something to do with the year the song was released (further information was kept from me during development, and I cannot disclose it).
